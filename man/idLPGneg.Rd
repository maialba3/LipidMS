\arguments{
\item{msobject}{an msobject returned by \link{dataProcessing}.}

\item{ppm_precursor}{mass tolerance for precursor ions. By default, 5 ppm.}

\item{ppm_products}{mass tolerance for product ions. By default, 10 ppm.}

\item{rttol}{total rt window for coelution between precursor and product
ions. By default, 3 seconds.}

\item{rt}{rt range where the function will look for candidates. By default,
it will search within all RT range in MS1.}

\item{adducts}{expected adducts for LPG in ESI-. Adducts allowed can
be modified in adductsTable (dbs argument).}

\item{clfrags}{vector containing the expected fragments for a given lipid
class. See \link{checkClass} for details.}

\item{clrequired}{logical vector indicating if each class fragment is
required or not. If any of them is required, at least one of them must be
present within the coeluting fragments. See \link{checkClass} for details.}

\item{ftype}{character vector indicating the type of fragments in clfrags.
It can be: "F" (fragment), "NL" (neutral loss) or "BB" (building block).
See \link{checkClass} for details.}

\item{chainfrags_sn1}{character vector containing the fragmentation rules for
the chain fragments. See \link{chainFrags} for details.}

\item{coelCutoff}{coelution score threshold between parent and fragment ions.
Only applied if rawData info is supplied. By default, 0.8.}

\item{dbs}{list of data bases required for annotation. By default, dbs
contains the required data frames based on the default fragmentation rules.
If these rules are modified, dbs may need to be supplied. See \link{createLipidDB}
and \link{assignDB}.}
}
\value{
annotated msobject (list with several elements). The results element
is a data frame that shows: ID, class of lipid, CDB (total number of carbons
and double bounds), FA composition (specific chains composition if it has
been confirmed), m.z, RT (in seconds), I (intensity), Adducts, ppm (m.z error),
confidenceLevel (Subclass, FA level, where chains are known but not their
positions, or FA position level), peakID, and PFCS (parent-fragment coelution
score mean of all fragments used for the identification); and the
annotatedPeaklist element shows the original MS1 peaklist with the annotations
on it.

\description{
LPG identification based on fragmentation patterns for LC-MS/MS DIA or DDA
data acquired in negative mode.
}
\details{
\code{idLPGneg} function involves 3 steps. 1) FullMS-based
identification of candidate LPG as M-H. 2) Search of LPG class fragments:
152.9958, 227.0326, 209.022 and neutral loss of 74.0359 coeluting with the
precursor ion. 3) Search of specific fragments that confirm chain composition
(FA as M-H).

Results data frame shows: ID, class of lipid, CDB (total number of carbons
and double bounds), FA composition (specific chains composition if
it has been confirmed), mz, RT (in seconds), I (intensity, which comes
directly from de input), Adducts, ppm (m.z error), confidenceLevel (in this
case, as LPG only have one chain, only Subclass and FA level are possible)
and PFCS (parent-fragment coelution score mean of all fragments used
for the identification).
}
\note{
This function has been writen based on fragmentation patterns
observed for three different platforms (QTOF 6550 from Agilent, Sinapt G2-Si
from Waters and Q-exactive from Thermo), but it may need to be customized for
other platforms or acquisition settings.
