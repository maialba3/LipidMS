\arguments{
\item{msobject}{an msobject returned by \link{dataProcessing}.}

\item{ppm_precursor}{mass tolerance for precursor ions. By default, 5 ppm.}

\item{ppm_products}{mass tolerance for product ions. By default, 10 ppm.}

\item{rttol}{total rt window for coelution between precursor and product
ions. By default, 3 seconds.}

\item{rt}{rt range where the function will look for candidates. By default,
it will search within all RT range in MS1.}

\item{adducts}{expected adducts for PCo in ESI-. Adducts allowed can
be modified in adductsTable (dbs argument).}

\item{clfrags}{vector containing the expected fragments for a given lipid
class. See \link{checkClass} for details.}

\item{clrequired}{logical vector indicating if each class fragment is
required or not. If any of them is required, at least one of them must be
present within the coeluting fragments. See \link{checkClass} for details.}

\item{ftype}{character vector indicating the type of fragments in clfrags.
It can be: "F" (fragment), "NL" (neutral loss) or "BB" (building block).
See \link{checkClass} for details.}

\item{chainfrags_sn1}{character vector containing the fragmentation rules for
the chain fragments in sn1 position. See \link{chainFrags} for details.}

\item{chainfrags_sn2}{character vector containing the fragmentation rules for
the chain fragments in sn2 position. See \link{chainFrags} for details. If
empty, it will be estimated based on the difference between precursors and
sn1 chains.}

\item{intrules}{character vector specifying the fragments to compare. See
\link{checkIntensityRules}.}

\item{rates}{character vector with the expected rates between fragments given
as a string (e.g. "3/1"). See \link{checkIntensityRules}.}

\item{intrequired}{logical vector indicating if any of the rules is required.
If not, at least one must be verified to confirm the structure.}

\item{coelCutoff}{coelution score threshold between parent and fragment ions.
Only applied if rawData info is supplied. By default, 0.8.}

\item{dbs}{list of data bases required for annotation. By default, dbs
contains the required data frames based on the default fragmentation rules.
If these rules are modified, dbs may need to be supplied. See \link{createLipidDB}
and \link{assignDB}.}

\value{
annotated msobject (list with several elements). The results element
is a data frame that shows: ID, lipid class, CDB (total number of carbons
and double bounds), FA composition (specific chains composition if it has
been confirmed), mz, RT (in seconds), I (intensity), Adducts, ppm (mz error),
confidenceLevel (Subclass, FA level, where chains are known but not their
positions, or FA position level), peakID, and Score (parent-fragment coelution 
score mean in DIA data or relative sum intensity in DDA of all fragments used 
for the identification).

\description{
PCo identification based on fragmentation patterns for LC-MS/MS DIA or DDA
data acquired in negative mode.
}
\details{
\code{idPConeg} function involves 5 steps. 1) FullMS-based
identification of candidate PCo as M+CH3COO, M-CH3 or M+CH3COO-CH3. To avoid
incorrect annotations of PEo as PCo, candidates which are present just as M-CH3
will be ignored. 2) Search of PCo class fragments: 168.0426, 224.0688 or loss
of CH3 coeluting with the precursor ion. 3) Search of specific fragments that
inform about chain composition in sn1 (LPCo as M-CH3 and M-CH3-H2O resulting 
from the loss of the FA chain at sn2) and sn2 (FA as M-H and M-CO2-H). 
4) Look for possible chains structure based on the  combination of chain 
fragments. 5) Check intensity rules to confirm chains position. In this case, 
FA fragments from sn2 are at least 3 times more intense than LPCo from sn1.

Results data frame shows: ID, lipid class, CDB (total number
of carbons and double bounds), FA composition (specific chains composition if
it has been confirmed), mz, RT (in seconds), I (intensity, which comes
directly from de input), Adducts, ppm (mz error), confidenceLevel (Subclass,
FA level, where chains are known but not their positions, or FA position
level) and Score (parent-fragment coelution score mean in DIA data or relative 
sum intensity in DDA of all fragments used for the identification).

\note{
This function has been writen based on fragmentation patterns
observed for three different platforms (QTOF 6550 from Agilent, Sinapt G2-Si
from Waters and Q-exactive from Thermo), but it may need to be customized for
other platforms or acquisition settings.
