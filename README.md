# LipidMS v3.0
Lipid Annotation for LC-MS/MS DIA and DDA data analysis. New features:

  - Batch processing: peak-picking, grouping and alignment wrapped in batchdataProcessing(). Lipid annotation for msbatch objects simplified with annotatemsbatch().
  - New lipid classes: plasmanyl and plasmenyl PC and PE, acylceramides and ceramides phosphate.
  - GUI through shiny app running LipidMSapp().
  - Improved graphical outputs for lipid annotation.
